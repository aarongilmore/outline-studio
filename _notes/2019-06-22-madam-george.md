I discovered Ursula K. Le Guin quite by accident — on the library shelf, but not in the science fiction section. I was browsing the literary journals, which were stood up like little jewels in the entranceway of the library at Willamette University in Salem, Oregon.

I had been sent to that section of the library by my speech coach — sent to find a suitably thought-provoking and emotionally stimulating passage, with less than 50 percent dialogue, that I could read aloud without rushing in less than 8 minutes.

My task was to find a piece suitable for entering in competition in the Prose category, which demands of its high school competitors that they be “a master storyteller, drawing the audience in with a well-cut and interesting piece, energy and variety in vocal inflection, and the ability to engross the listener in what is being read.”

I was in high school in the tenth grade! One of my friends was thinking about applying to art and design school, and had a student prospective book featuring all the classes and majors. There was a graphic design section that featured posters, covers, websites and typefaces! All the things I was doing for fun anyways. I remember thinking, “Oh wow! I can major in this and do this as a job?!” So I basically dropped everything and enrolled in art classes at my high school.

I was in high school in the tenth grade! One of my friends was thinking about applying to art and design school, and had a student prospective book featuring all the classes and majors. There was a graphic design section that featured posters, covers, websites and typefaces! All the things I was doing for fun anyways. I remember thinking, “Oh wow! I can major in this and do this as a job?!” So I basically dropped everything and enrolled in art classes at my high school.
